		<p> 
		Fractals are self-similar forms on different scales. The leaves of a fern or the branches of a tree are typical examples. No part of the natural world appears free from them: ocean waves contain smaller waves, etc. a coast line has irregularities similar on all scales (viewed at different heights); a ploughed field has a clumpiness within a clumpiness; the foliages of a tree from leaf to whole tree reflect the branch hierarchy in its groups within groups; pebbles thrown on the ground organise fractally; even the stars in the sky visually reflect the fractal organisation; and we might add to this list--though not recognised in current science--the 'clumpiness' of the universe (which the Big Bang theory fails to explain), such as planets within star systems, within larger systems, within the galaxies, within galaxy clusters, within superclusters of galaxies, within the universe.
